                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
    I am Ezatullah Noori, a passionate and driven Mechanical
    Engineering student currently pursuing a Diploma of Engineering - 
    Technical (Mechanical Engineering) at TAFE NSW. I began my educational 
    journey by completing Certificate II, III, and IV in English at TAFE NSW
     (2022-2023), which laid a strong foundation for my career in Australia.
    In August 2023, I embarked on my career path in Mechanical Engineering,
     starting with Certificate III in Mechanical Engineering at TAFE NSW. 
     My goal is to continue gaining hands-on experience, expanding my 
     knowledge, and contributing to real-world projects.
    In my free time, I am committed to self-improvement by reading books,
     staying active in the gym, and preparing for future opportunities. 
     I value teamwork, enjoy collaboration, and aim to grow in both 
     professional and personal aspects of life.
